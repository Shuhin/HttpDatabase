# HttpDatabase

Raw code for manipulating database using node,js

I have tried 3 things here Http, express and both mysql and Mongodatabase

if you want to see the basic http server with Mysql database run the httpdatabase.js file

if you want to see the basic http server with Nosql(MongoDB) database run the mongodatabase.js file

if you want to see the basic function of express with Mysql database run the expressdatabase.js file
